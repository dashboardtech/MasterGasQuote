1. **Complete Quote Test**: Tested a quote with all fields populated (timeline, site factors, operational costs)
2. **Missing Timeline Test**: Tested a quote with undefined timeline data
3. **Missing Site Factors Test**: Tested a quote with undefined site factors data
4. **Missing Operational Costs Test**: Tested a quote with undefined operational costs data
5. **Empty Arrays Test**: Tested a quote with empty arrays in JSON fields

The tests confirmed that our type assertions and default values handle all these scenarios correctly without TypeScript errors.

## Final Summary

We have successfully completed all the tasks related to fixing TypeScript errors in the quotes editing component:

1. ✅ **Fixed TypeScript Errors**: Added proper type assertions for timeline, site factors, and operational costs properties in the quotes editing component.

3. ✅ **Created Test Script**: Implemented a comprehensive test script (`quote-editor-test.ts`) that verifies the functionality of the quotes editing component with different data scenarios.

4. ✅ **Ran Tests**: Successfully executed the tests and verified that all scenarios pass without TypeScript errors.

5. ✅ **Added Test Documentation**: Updated the README.md with a Testing section that explains how to run the tests and what scenarios are covered.

The project now has improved type safety and better documentation for handling JSON blob fields in TypeScript. The test script provides a way to verify that these improvements continue to work correctly as the codebase evolves.

## Dynamic Quoting System Development Plan

## Overview

We're developing a revolutionary dynamic quoting system that breaks free from spreadsheet hell, creating a logic-driven system that handles the complex dependencies and calculations for fuel station projects. This system automates the selection and pricing of components, calculates dependencies, and generates comprehensive quotes based on user inputs and predefined business logic.

## Current Progress

   - Add fallback UI for when API calls fail

## The Vision: Breaking Free from Spreadsheet Hell

Transitioning from static Excel models to a dynamic, logic-driven system that enables quick quotes by leveraging price lists and calculation formulas while automatically linking dependent components. This liberates the workflow from manual entry into an automated, efficient process.

## Core Components and Their Interactions

### Tanks and Pump Assignments

- **Tanks**: Support for multiple tanks with variable sizes. Each tank's characteristics (volume, dimensions, etc.) determine other factors like pump capacity and soil movement.
- **Pump Matching**: Logic to assign appropriately sized pumps for each tank based on thresholds and performance criteria that must match the tank's specifications.

### Pipe Management

- **Pipes & Connectors**: Handle different types of pipes (materials, diameters) with variable lengths and corresponding connectors, whether behind dispensers or under them.
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Calculate total pipe length and cost impact of varying connector types using formulas that adjust based on inputs.

### Sump Dispensers and Containment

- **Sump Dispensers**: Plastic containment units under each dispenser for capturing fuel drops and ensuring clean installation. Cost and specs vary with each dispenser.
- **Tank Containers**: Units installed on top of tanks to house pumps, including specific boots and mounting hardware that add another calculation layer.

### Electrical Wiring and Infrastructure

- **Wiring**: Calculate power requirements for pumps and dispensers based on length and electrical load. Longer wiring means higher costs.
- **Integration with Equipment**: Dynamically link wiring requirements to both pump and dispenser selections for matching electrical specifications.

### Soil Movement, Concrete, and Labor

- **Soil & Excavation**: Calculate soil movement, removal, and filling based on tank size and installation depth using precise volume calculations.
- **Concrete Calculations**: Consider concrete quantity and labor for pouring and finishing, with formulas converting tank dimensions and ground conditions into volume estimates.
- **Manpower**: Structure the system to eventually incorporate labor costs as an add-on.

## Integration Strategy

1. **Prototype the Logic**: Start with Excel/Python hybrid to validate calculations and relationships using existing spreadsheet formulas.
2. **Data Modeling**: Build a database with all components (prices, dimensions, material types) and embed conversion factors between units.
3. **Automation Engine**: Develop a modular engine that fetches necessary values, computes totals, and generates detailed quotes based on inputs.
4. **Iterative Integration**: Merge logic into a web application, testing each module independently before full integration.

## Lessons

- For local development, we need to provide a database connection via DATABASE_URL
- PostgreSQL connection issues can be worked around by using SQLite for development
- Include debug information in program output to help troubleshoot issues
- When handling errors, use specific error types instead of 'any' for better type safety
- For SVG elements in JSX, use self-closing tags (e.g., `<circle />`) and add `aria-hidden="true"` for accessibility
- When dealing with potentially null values in event handlers, use conditional checks instead of non-null assertions
- Group related items by category for better organization and user experience
- Implement form validation to ensure data integrity before submission
- When testing API functionality, create dedicated test scripts to verify each feature
- Use proper error handling in test scripts to provide clear feedback on failures
- When working with nullable fields in TypeScript, use default values or optional chaining instead of non-null assertions
- For SQLite JSON fields, ensure proper serialization and deserialization of complex objects
- When using SQLite with JSON blob fields, convert undefined values to null explicitly
- SQLite can only bind numbers, strings, bigints, buffers, and null values (not undefined or objects)
- Date objects must be converted to ISO strings for SQLite compatibility
- Enhanced error logging is crucial for diagnosing database-related issues
- Always prepare data properly before inserting into the database to avoid type errors
- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- When using Tailwind CSS with PostCSS, make sure to import from '@tailwindcss/postcss' package
- Use 'type' import prefix for TypeScript imports that are only used as types
- When converting between string and number types in TypeScript, always handle null/undefined values
- Convert div elements with role="button" to actual button elements with type="button" for better accessibility
- Add id attributes to form elements and associate them with labels using htmlFor
- When working with JSON blob fields in TypeScript, use type assertions with optional chaining: `(object as Type | undefined)?.property`
- Always provide default values for properties that might be undefined: `(object as Type | undefined)?.property || defaultValue`
- For arrays in JSON fields, provide an empty array as default: `(object as Type | undefined)?.array || []`
